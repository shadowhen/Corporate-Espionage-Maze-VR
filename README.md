# Corporate Espionage
A office maze VR game where you, the player, escape the office by finding the
exit. The game is made for the Quest 2 and made for special topic class in
virtual and extended reality at Mississippi State University in fall 2022.

## Story
You are a worker for a rival business company and have been sent on a mission
by your boss to infiltrate “The Corporate Headquarters” of the rival business 
to steal their “documents.” After successfully sneaking into their headquarters, 
you have retrieved the document! However, you have forgotten the way you came in 
and must navigate the maze-like office to escape and return the documents to 
your boss. Luckily you stole the documents on a Sunday, so the office is empty.
